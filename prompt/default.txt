Analyze this code diff and provide detailed feedback. For EACH issue found, provide:

1. üö® **Risk Level & Issue Title** (High/Medium/Low Risk: Brief description)
2. **Detailed Explanation** (2-3 lines explaining WHY this is problematic)
3. **Impact Assessment** (What could go wrong if not fixed)
4. **Specific Fix Suggestion** (Concrete steps to resolve the issue)

üö® SECURITY ANALYSIS:
- Hardcoded secrets (passwords, API keys, tokens, connection strings)
- Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, Command injection, Path traversal)
- Insecure functions and weak cryptography implementations
- Authentication bypasses and authorization flaws
- Unsafe deserialization and file operations

‚ö†Ô∏è QUALITY ANALYSIS:
- Memory leaks, resource management, and cleanup issues
- Error handling gaps and exception management problems
- Performance bottlenecks and inefficient algorithms
- Thread safety violations and concurrency issues
- Logic errors, infinite loops, and null/undefined access

üí° STYLE & MAINTAINABILITY:
- Debug statements, console logs, and test comments left in code
- Code smells, unused variables, and dead code
- Formatting inconsistencies and naming violations
- Missing documentation and poor code organization

FORMAT: Each issue should be 3-4 lines total with clear actionable suggestions.
