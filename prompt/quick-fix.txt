ðŸ”§ QUICK-FIX FOCUSED REVIEW

Identify issues with immediate, actionable solutions. For each problem:

1. âš¡ **Quick Fix** (1-line summary of the immediate solution)
2. **Fix Time** (Estimated minutes/hours to implement)
3. **Step-by-Step** (Specific actions to resolve the issue)
4. **Verification** (How to test that the fix works)

ðŸŽ¯ PRIORITIZE EASILY FIXABLE ISSUES:
- Hardcoded values that should be configuration
- Missing error handling around risky operations
- Debug statements and console logs left in code
- Unused imports and dead code removal
- Simple performance wins (caching, memoization)
- Basic security fixes (input validation, sanitization)
- Missing null checks and boundary validations
- Formatting and linting rule violations

âœ… PROVIDE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE:
- Implementable in under 30 minutes
- Don't require major architecture changes
- Have clear testing criteria
- Include specific code examples

FORMAT: Focus on actionable solutions rather than lengthy explanations. 3 lines max per issue with concrete next steps.
