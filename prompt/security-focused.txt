üîí SECURITY-FOCUSED CODE REVIEW

Focus EXCLUSIVELY on security vulnerabilities. For each security issue found:

1. üö® **Severity & Threat** (Critical/High/Medium: Security threat description)
2. **Attack Vector** (How an attacker could exploit this vulnerability)
3. **Business Impact** (Data breach, system compromise, compliance violations)
4. **Security Fix** (Specific secure coding solution with examples)

üîç PRIORITIZE THESE SECURITY RISKS:
- Authentication & Authorization bypasses
- Input validation failures (SQL injection, XSS, Command injection)
- Hardcoded secrets and cryptographic weaknesses
- Insecure data handling and storage
- Race conditions and time-of-check vulnerabilities
- Unsafe deserialization and file operations
- Information disclosure and privilege escalation
- API security flaws and CORS misconfigurations

‚ö†Ô∏è IGNORE: Style issues, minor performance concerns, non-security code smells

FORMAT: Provide detailed 4-line security assessments with specific remediation steps and code examples where possible.
